# SweetDate Ruby Environment

This repository contains two Ruby projects:

1. **`sweet_date/`** â€“ A Ruby gem that communicates with the SweetDate TCP server (`sd_engine`) over a custom protocol.
2. **`paddle/`** â€“ A full-featured Rails app for testing and demonstrating the integration with `sweet_date`.
